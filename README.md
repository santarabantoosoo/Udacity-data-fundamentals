Udacity data fundamentals Nanodegree -- Activities and resources

## Resources

In Udacity connect sessions for data fundamentals nanodegree offered By [Makeen](https://makeen-nanodegrees.com/), we have three main resources to share.

1- Tasks
2- Resources[links and cheat sheets, etc.]
3- presentations

This repo is mainly for the first two items; tasks and resources

If you want the presentations, [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qK8KHX7qsLRYlTlYxVrl9zaJq9P2xacg?usp=sharing) you go

The distinction between the repos is mainly because the presentation increase the size of the repo. This may limit the ease of cloning the repo. This may have a negative impact as we may need to clone the repo each week, just before the session.
